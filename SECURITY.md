# Security Guidelines

## 🔒 Environment Variables & Secrets

### ✅ DO
- Use `env.local` for local development (already gitignored)
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Keep secrets in secure environment variable systems in production
- Use the `env.example` file as a template (with placeholder values)

### ❌ DON'T
- **Never commit real API tokens, passwords, or secrets to git**
- Don't put sensitive data in documentation files
- Don't hardcode secrets in source code
- Don't commit `.env` files with real values

## 🛡️ Current Security Measures

### Environment Protection
- `env.local` is gitignored and safe for local development
- `env.example` contains only placeholder values
- Additional security patterns added to `.gitignore`

### API Security
- Bearer token authentication for Fynd Platform API
- Request timeout and retry limits configured
- Rate limiting enabled in production

### Headers & Security
- Security headers middleware enabled
- CORS protection configured
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- XSS protection enabled

## 🚨 Security Checklist

Before committing code:

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in source code
- [ ] No real API tokens in documentation
- [ ] Environment variables used for all sensitive data
- [ ] `.gitignore` updated for new secret file patterns
- [ ] Security headers properly configured

## 📞 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Contact the development team directly
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Wait for confirmation before disclosing publicly

## 🔄 Regular Security Audits

Run these commands regularly to check for security issues:

```bash
# Check for potential secrets in codebase
grep -r -i "token\|key\|secret\|password" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"

# Verify gitignore is working
git check-ignore env.local

# Check what would be committed
git status --porcelain
```

## 🏗️ Production Deployment Security

- Use secure environment variable management (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Enable HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Configure proper CORS origins
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Regular security updates for dependencies
